# MemeBot
A custom bot that was made for the Jepsquad, which allowed members to regurgitate memes and shitposts associated with the community.

As of 17th January 2021, this project has been archived. The code has been left here for anyone who is interested in it: the functionality of the bot itself was migrated to Pylon, a freely available bot that lets you write custom bot code without the associated hosting requirements, and its Pylon which now powers this functionality for the Jepsquad.
